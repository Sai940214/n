//Task 4.4: Linear Search
//Create a program that finds specific items in an array. 
//1. Create an array with the following items: 55, 23, 
//6456, 324, 21, 234, 72, 21
//2. Ask the user what they want to search for in the integer array. 
//3. Loop through the array and compare the values with the input given by the user. 
//4. If the item is found, print out in which index the value was found. 
//5. If the item is not found, print out a message saying item was not found.
